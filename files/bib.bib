Insects can locate their hosts even though the host plants are often hidden among an array of other plants. Plant volatiles play an important role in this host-location process. The recognition of a host plant by these olfactory signals could occur by using either species-specific compounds or specific ratios of ubiquitous compounds. Currently, most studies favor the second scenario, with strong evidence that plant discrimination is due to central processing of olfactory signals by the insect, rather than their initial detection. Furthermore, paired or clustered olfactory receptor neurons might enable fine-scale spatio-temporal resolution of the complex signals encountered when ubiquitous compounds are used.},

	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success−they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Aim Biotic interactions – within guilds or across trophic levels – have widely been ignored in species distribution models ({SDMs}). This synthesis outlines the development of ‘species interaction distribution models’ ({SIDMs}), which aim to incorporate multispecies interactions at large spatial extents using interaction matrices.Location Local to global.Methods We review recent approaches for extending classical {SDMs} to incorporate biotic interactions, and identify some methodological and conceptual limitations. To illustrate possible directions for conceptual advancement we explore three principal ways of modelling multispecies interactions using interaction matrices: simple qualitative linkages between species, quantitative interaction coefficients reflecting interaction strengths, and interactions mediated by interaction currencies. We explain methodological advancements for static interaction data and multispecies time series, and outline methods to reduce complexity when modelling multispecies interactions.Results Classical {SDMs} ignore biotic interactions and recent {SDM} extensions only include the unidirectional influence of one or a few species. However, novel methods using error matrices in multivariate regression models allow interactions between multiple species to be modelled explicitly with spatial co-occurrence data. If time series are available, multivariate versions of population dynamic models can be applied that account for the effects and relative importance of species interactions and environmental drivers. These methods need to be extended by incorporating the non-stationarity in interaction coefficients across space and time, and are challenged by the limited empirical knowledge on spatio-temporal variation in the existence and strength of species interactions. Model complexity may be reduced by: (1) using prior ecological knowledge to set a subset of interaction coefficients to zero, (2) modelling guilds and functional groups rather than individual species, and (3) modelling interaction currencies and species’ effect and response traits.Main conclusions There is great potential for developing novel approaches that incorporate multispecies interactions into the projection of species distributions and community structure at large spatial extents. Progress can be made by: (1) developing statistical models with interaction matrices for multispecies co-occurrence datasets across large-scale environmental gradients, (2) testing the potential and limitations of methods for complexity reduction, and (3) sampling and monitoring comprehensive spatio-temporal data on biotic interactions in multispecies communities.},

Ideally, however, it would be possible to call any R function from within a {NetLogo} program. This would allow sophisticated interactive statistical analysis of model structure and dynamics, using R functions and packages for generating certain statistical distributions and experimental design, and for implementing complex descriptive submodels within {ABMs}. Here we present an R extension of {NetLogo}. It consists of only nine new {NetLogo} primitives for sending data between {NetLogo} and R and for calling R functions (six additional primitives for debugging). We demonstrate the usage of the R extension with three short examples.},

These networks have previously been seen primarily as a means of representing knowledge derived from experts. Here it is shown that the “Gibbs sampling” simulation procedure for such networks can support maximum-likelihood learning from empirical data through local gradient ascent. This learning procedure resembles that used for “Boltzmann machines”, and like it, allows the use of “hidden” variables to model correlations between visible variables. Due to the directed nature of the connections in a belief network, however, the “negative phase” of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. Experimental results show that, as a result, learning in a sigmoid belief network can be faster than in a Boltzmann machine. These networks have other advantages over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications, are naturally applicable to unsupervised learning problems, and provide a link between work on connectionist learning and work on the representation of expert knowledge.},

Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into {SDMs}. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based {SDMs} can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic {SDMs} have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into {SDMs}, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

	abstract = {The web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.},

	abstract = {Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations, distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping, derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.},

	abstract = {Predation risk often varies in space and time. To respond adaptively to fluctuations in risk, prey must sample to gain information on the current presence or absence of predators. Bayesian statistical decision theory provides a framework for modeling the effects of prey uncertainty about predation risk on prey behavior. The model predicts that due to prey uncertainty, prey should often stay in refuge long after predators have left an area. Prey behavioral time lags should depend on the quality of prey information about predation risk and on the costs and benefits of refuge use. Under biologically reasonable conditions (e.g., if prey escape success is low), uncertainty can cause prey to always stay in refuge even though predators are only occasionally present. Although many studies have examined prey responses to predator addition, few studies have quantified prey responses to predator removal. Observations on the responses of juvenile aquatic bugs, Notonecta hoffmani, to the experimental addition and removal of cannibalistic adults showed that, as predicted by theory, prey behavioral time lags were longer when predator density was higher, prey were less hungry, and prey had lower escape ability.},

At least nine ideas exist regarding how plasticity may be costly or limited, but these have rarely been discussed together. The most commonly discussed cost is that of maintaining the sensory and regulatory machinery needed for plasticity, which may require energy and material expenses. A frequently considered limit to the benefit of plasticity is that the environmental cues guiding plastic development can be unreliable. Such costs and limits have recently been included in theoretical models and, perhaps more importantly, relevant empirical studies now have emerged. Despite the current interest in costs and limits of plasticity, several lines of reasoning suggest that they might be difficult to demonstrate.},

	abstract = {We show that occupancy models are more difficult to fit than is generally appreciated because the estimating equations often have multiple solutions, including boundary estimates which produce fitted probabilities of zero or one. The estimates are unstable when the data are sparse, making them difficult to interpret, and, even in ideal situations, highly variable. As a consequence, making accurate inference is difficult. When abundance varies over sites (which is the general rule in ecology because we expect spatial variance in abundance) and detection depends on abundance, the standard analysis suffers bias (attenuation in detection, biased estimates of occupancy and potentially finding misleading relationships between occupancy and other covariates), asymmetric sampling distributions, and slow convergence of the sampling distributions to normality. The key result of this paper is that the biases are of similar magnitude to those obtained when we ignore non-detection entirely. The fact that abundance is subject to detection error and hence is not directly observable, means that we cannot tell when bias is present (or, equivalently, how large it is) and we cannot adjust for it. This implies that we cannot tell which fit is better: the fit from the occupancy model or the fit ignoring the possibility of detection error. Therefore trying to adjust occupancy models for non-detection can be as misleading as ignoring non-detection completely. Ignoring non-detection can actually be better than trying to adjust for it.},

	abstract = {Conservation and management actions often have direct and indirect effects on a wide range of species. As such, it is important to evaluate the impacts that such actions may have on both target and non-target species within a region. Understanding how species richness and composition differ as a result of management treatments can help determine potential ecological consequences. Yet it is difficult to estimate richness because traditional sampling approaches detect species at variable rates and some species are never observed. We present a framework for assessing management actions on biodiversity using a multi-species hierarchical model that estimates individual species occurrences, while accounting for imperfect detection of species. Our model incorporates species-specific responses to management treatments and local vegetation characteristics and a hierarchical component that links species at a community-level. This allows for comprehensive inferences on the whole community or on assemblages of interest. Compared to traditional species models, occurrence estimates are improved for all species, even for those that are rarely observed, resulting in more precise estimates of species richness (including species that were unobserved during sampling). We demonstrate the utility of this approach for conservation through an analysis comparing bird communities in two geographically similar study areas: one in which white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities have been regulated through hunting and one in which deer densities have gone unregulated. Although our results indicate that species and assemblage richness were similar in the two study areas, point-level richness was significantly influenced by local vegetation characteristics, a result that would have been underestimated had we not accounted for variability in species detection.},

	abstract = {1. Developing the next-generation of species distribution modelling ({SDM}) requires solutions to a number of widely recognised problems. Here, we address the problem of uncertainty in predictor variables arising from fine-scale environmental variation.2. We explain how this uncertainty may cause scale-dependent ‘regression dilution’, elsewhere a well-understood statistical issue, and explain its consequences for {SDM}. We then demonstrate a simple, general correction for regression dilution based on Bayesian methods using latent variables. With this correction in place, unbiased estimates of species occupancy vs. the true environment can be retrieved from data on occupancy vs. measured environment, where measured environment is correlated with the true environment, but subject to substantial measurement error.3. We then show how applying our correction to multiple co-occurring species simultaneously increases the accuracy of parameter estimates for each species, as well as estimates for the true environment at each survey plot – a phenomenon we call ‘neighbourly advice’. With a sufficient number of species, the estimates of the true environment at each plot can become extremely accurate.4. Our correction for regression dilution could be integrated with models addressing other issues in {SDM}, e.g. biotic interactions and/or spatial dynamics. We suggest that Bayesian analysis, as employed here to address uncertainty in predictor variables, might offer a flexible toolbox for developing such next-generation species distribution models.},

	abstract = {Over the last three decades, many studies have attempted to explain forager diets by using optimal diet theory ({ODT}). Despite some obvious successes, the utility of this theory remains controversial. We reviewed the results of 134 studies of optimal diet theory to test hypotheses on factors that can explain variation in the ability of {ODT} to predict diets and diet shifts in response to changes in prey availability. Our major conclusion is that while {ODT} has generally worked well for foragers that feed on immobile prey, the theory often failed to predict the diets of foragers that attack mobile prey. We found only mixed support for the hypothesis that the theory works better when the study scenario more closely fits the assumptions of the model. Contrary to our a priori predictions, forager types (invertebrate versus ectothermic vertebrate versus endothermic vertebrate) did not differ in their likelihood of corroborating {ODT}. Two explanations for why optimal diet theory does not work well with mobile prey are that studies on mobile prey often lack information on key parameters that are required to rigorously test {ODT}, and that with mobile prey, variations among prey in vulnerability (encounter rate and capture success) are often more important than variation in predator active choice in determining predator diets.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic independence among multiple random variables (e.g., among the outputs of multiple spatial-frequency channels) has been invoked to explain two effects found with many kinds of stimuli: increments in detection performance due to "probability summation" and decrements in detection and identification performance due to "extrinsic uncertainty." Quantitative predictions of such effects, however, depend on the precise assumptions. Here we calculate predictions from multidimensional signal-detection theory assuming any of several different probability distributions characterizing the random variables (including two-state, Gaussian, exponential, and double-exponential distributions) and either of two rules for combining the multiple random variables into a single decision variable (taking the maximum or summing them). In general, the probability distributions predicting shallower {ROC} curves predict greater increments due to summation but smaller decrements due to extrinsic uncertainty. Some probability distributions yield steep-enough {ROC} curves to actually predict decrements due to summation in blocked-summation experiments. Probability distribution matters much less for intermixed-summation than for blocked-summation predictions. Of the two combination rules, the sum-of-outputs rule usually predicts both greater increments due to summation and greater decrements due to extrinsic uncertainty. Put another way, of the two combination rules, the sum-of-outputs rule usually predicts better performance on the compound stimulus under any condition but worse performance on simple stimuli under intermixed conditions.},

We show that by using the mean occurrence and co-occurrence of species as constraints, one is able to capture detailed statistics of a plant community distributed across a vast semiarid area of the United States. The approach allows us to quantify the species’ effective couplings: Their frequencies exhibit a peak at zero and the minimal pairwise model is able to capture about 80\% of the ecosystem structure. Our analysis reveals a relatively stronger impact of the species network on uncommon species and underscores the importance of species pairs experiencing positive couplings. Additionally, we study the associations among species and, interestingly, find that the frequencies of groups of different species, which the approach is able to capture, exhibit a power-law-like distribution.},

	abstract = {Animal reintroductions and translocations are potentially important interventions to save species from extinction, but most are unsuccessful. Mortality due to predation is a principal cause of failure. Animals that have been isolated from predators, either throughout their lifetime or over evolutionary time, may no longer express appropriate antipredator behavior. For this reason, conservation biologists are beginning to include antipredator training in pre-release preparation procedures. We describe the evolutionary and ontogenetic circumstances under which antipredator behavior may degenerate or be lost, and we use principles from learning theory to predict which elements can be enhanced or recovered by training. The empirical literature demonstrates that training can improve antipredator skills, but the effectiveness of such interventions is influenced by a number of constraints. We predict that it will be easier to teach animals to cope with predators if they have experienced ontogenetic isolation than if they have undergone evolutionary isolation. Similarly, animals should learn more easily if they have been evolutionarily isolated from some rather than all predators. Training to a novel predator may be more successful if a species has effective responses to similar predators. In contrast, it may be difficult to teach proper avoidance behavior, or to introduce specialized predator-specific responses, if appropriate motor patterns are not already present. We conclude that pre-release training has the potential to enhance the expression of preexisting antipredator behavior. Potential training techniques involve classical conditioning procedures in which animals learn that model predators are predictors of aversive events. However, wildlife managers should be aware that problems, such as the emergence of inappropriate responses, may arise during such training.},

In this review, I summarize a few key ideas about animal cognition developed in a recent book (Shettleworth 1998, Cognition, Evolution and Behaviour) and briefly review some areas in which interdisciplinary research on animal cognition is currently proving especially productive. Cognition, broadly defined, includes all ways in which animals take in information through the senses, process, retain and decide to act on it. Studying animal cognition does not entail any particular position on whether or to what degree animals are conscious. Neither does it entail rejecting behaviourism in that one of the greatest challenges in studing animal cognition is to formulate clear behavioural criteria for inferring specific mental processes. Tests of whether or not apparently goal-directed behaviour is controlled by a representation of its goal, episodic-like memory in birds, and deceptive behaviour in monkeys provide examples. Functional modelling has been integrated with analyses of cognitive mechanisms in a number of areas, including studies of communication, models of how predator learning and attention affect the evolution of conspicuous and cryptic prey, tests of the relationship betweeen ecological demands on spatial cognition and brain evolution, and in research on social learning. Rather than a [`]new field' of cognitive ecology, such interdisciplinary research on animal cognition exemplifies a revival of interest in proximate mechanisms of behaviour.},

In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and {MaxEnt}), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to “spatial sorting bias”: the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results ({AUC}) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than {MaxEnt} for 45\% and better than Bioclim for 67\% of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver–operator curve ({AUC}) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence–absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an {AUC} close to 0.5, such that {AUC} was the same as null model calibrated {AUC} ({cAUC}). This adjustment strongly decreased {AUC} values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model.},

	abstract = {Predators often feed on prey that show ineffective antipredator behavior. Gene flow among populations may constrain evolution of effective antipredator ability in larvae of the streamside salamander, Ambystoma barbouri, a species that occupies distinctly different habitats with conflicting selection pressures. Some streams are ephemeral, where larvae should be active to feed and reach metamorphosis before stream drying. In contrast, other streams are more permanent and contain pools with predatory fish, where larvae should remain inactive to avoid fish predation. Feeding rates and predator escape behavior were assayed for laboratory-reared larvae from 15 populations. Larval survival was also compared among populations in artificial streams with natural predators. Five populations represented streams subjected to fish predation along a gradient of genetic and geographic isolation from populations without fish; the remaining 10 populations were ephemeral and without fish. Individuals from populations with fish had significantly stronger behavioral responses to fish (i.e., decreased feeding rate associated with the presence of fish and increased escape response) than individuals from fishless populations. Larvae from populations containing fish that were more isolated from fishless populations showed stronger antipredator responses than less isolated populations. Further, larvae from more isolated populations survived longer in the predation experiment, indicating that the behaviors measured were related with survival. These results suggest that gene flow between populations with conflicting selection pressures limits local adaptation in some salamander populations with fish. While previous studies have typically focused on the role of gene flow in pairs of populations, the results of this study suggest that gene flow is acting to swamp local adaptation across several populations.},

This strategy yields rational predictions of risk if the product of concentration (C) and the duration of exposure (t yields constant effects on health (Haber's Rule). The validity of this assumption was evaluated by assessing the acute behavioral effects of inhaled trichloroethylene ({TCE}) vapor at various values of C and t. Adult male Long-Evans rats (n = 11) were trained to perform a signal detection task in which a press on one lever produced food on trials containing a signal (a brief, unpredictable light flash); a press on a second lever produced food on trials lacking a signal. Response time ({RT}) and indices of sensitivity ({SI}) and bias ({RI}) derived from the theory of signal detection were calculated at three times during repeated daily 60-min tests conducted in air containing 0, 400, 800, 1200,1600, 2000, or 2400 ppm {TCE}. Behavior remained stable during tests in air. In {TCE}, {SI} declined and {RT} increased as functions of both C and t. {RI} was not affected by {TCE}. Effects on {SI} and {RT} were not predictable from the C x t product: both endpoints were more affected by C than by t. To quantify the change in the effect of {TCE} across exposure times, concentration-effect relationships for inhaled {TCE} on {SI} and {RT} were modeled with cubic polynomial functions at each of the three exposure durations. Concentrations of inhaled {TCE} associated with preselected changes in {SI} and {RT} were then estimated for each animal from these functions. Criterion concentrations, {SI}0.1 and {RT}100, were defined as the concentration of {TCE} associated with a 0.1-unit decrease in {SI} or a 100-msec increase in {RT}, respectively. Both {SI}0.1, and {RT}100 increased as exposure duration decreased, but did so more slowly than would be predicted by Haber's Rule. This pattern indicates that application of Haber's Rule overestimates the concentration of inhaled {TCE} associated with changes in signal detection and thus underestimates the risk of behavior change from short-term exposures to {TCE}. On the other hand, the fact that {SI}0.1, and {RT}100 did increase with shorter exposure times indicates that the converse assumption, that the toxicity of inhaled {TCE} is independent of the duration of exposure, yields an overly conservative estimate of risk.},

	abstract = {Many animals produce and respond to signals made up of multiple components. For example, many avian sexual displays are highly extravagant combinations of visual and acoustic elements, and are described as being [`]multicomponent'. One possible reason for the evolution of such complex signals is that they provide more reliable information for receivers. However, receivers also influence signal evolution in another important way, by how they perceive and process signals: signallers will be selected to produce signals that are more easily received. The potential role of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals has not previously been considered; in this review I present psychological results that support the notion that two components are better received than one alone. Detection can be improved by producing two components together, thus reducing the reaction time, increasing the probability of detection and lowering the intensity at which detection occurs. Discriminability of multicomponent stimuli is also made easier through better recognition, faster discrimination learning and multidimensional generalization. In addition, multicomponent stimuli also improve associative learning. I show that multicomponency does indeed improve signal reception in receivers, although the benefits of producing components in two sensory modalities (bimodal multicomponent signals) may be larger and more robust than producing them in just one (unimodal multicomponent signals). This highlights the need for consideration of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals, and suggests that where signal components do not appear to be informative, they may instead be performing an important psychological function.},

	abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models ({GLM}) and Generalised Additive Models ({GAM}). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression ({QR}) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling ({SEM}) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression ({GWR}) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology.},

The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment activities including visualization of spatial patterns in community composition, constrained environmental classification, distributional modelling of species or community types, survey gap analysis, conservation assessment, and climate-change impact assessment.},

Here we developed an experimental test of the theory in which we sequentially presented computer-generated Mimics (profitable to attack) and Models (unprofitable to attack) to human volunteers, and asked them to forage in a way that maximized their personal scores. Both the Mimics and Models exhibited normally distributed variation in a single stimulus dimension. When we varied the mean similarity of Mimics to Models, and the proportion of all prey items that were Mimics, our human predators made foraging decisions that were close to those predicted by {SDT}, including the adoption of a threshold in appearance beyond which prey items were unlikely to be attacked. The fit of predictions to observations was marginally closer when including the time taken to handle the two types of prey. When Mimics and Models were allowed to evolve in appearance subject to selection, the evolutionary trajectory fitted the predictions of {SDT} closely. While our system was not appropriate to test all predictions of recent {SDT} theory, it provides strong support for the {SDT} framework as it applies to Batesian mimicry.},

	abstract = {Aim Distribution modelling relates sparse data on species occurrence or abundance to environmental information to predict the population of a species at any point in space. Recently, the importance of spatial autocorrelation in distributions has been recognized. Spatial autocorrelation can be categorized as exogenous (stemming from autocorrelation in the underlying variables) or endogenous (stemming from activities of the organism itself, such as dispersal). Typically, one asks whether spatial models explain additional variability (endogenous) in comparison to a fully specified habitat model. We turned this question around and asked: can habitat models explain additional variation when spatial structure is accounted for in a fully specified spatially explicit model? The aim was to find out to what degree habitat models may be inadvertently capturing spatial structure rather than true explanatory mechanisms.Location We used data from 190 species of the North American Breeding Bird Survey covering the conterminous United States and southern Canada.Methods We built 13 different models on 190 bird species using regression trees. Our habitat-based models used climate and landcover variables as independent variables. We also used random variables and simulated ranges to validate our results. The two spatially explicit models included only geographical coordinates or a contagion term as independent variables. As another angle on the question of mechanism vs. spatial structure we pitted a model using related bird species as predictors against a model using randomly selected bird species.Results The spatially explicit models outperformed the traditional habitat models and the random predictor species outperformed the related predictor species. In addition, environmental variables produced a substantial R2 in predicting artificial ranges.Main conclusions We conclude that many explanatory variables with suitable spatial structure can work well in species distribution models. The predictive power of environmental variables is not necessarily mechanistic, and spatial interpolation can outperform environmental explanatory variables.},

The organisms were sampled in four stations along the polymetallic contamination gradient. Cd and Zn analysis were carried out in five organs (gills, posterior intestine, liver, kidneys and skeletal muscle) in order to highlight the potential pathways of uptake, storage and elimination of metals. The results indicate a very strong Cd contamination in fish collected downstream from the metal source. The kidneys have the highest cadmium concentrations, but the gills and the intestine, as exchange organs, present the largest variations between the stations in close relation with the contamination gradient. Cd concentrations measured in the liver vary only slightly among the sampling stations. Unlike the trends observed for Cd, Zn levels in fish populations are strongly regulated and do not follow ambient Zn concentrations. The concentrations measured vary also according to fish species, for both Cd and Zn. This study shows that the trophic habits can explain the interspecific differences in Cd bioaccumulation. Zn levels observed for each species in non-contaminated populations also help to understand metal bioaccumulation patterns in polluted sites, suggesting that the determinism of interspecific differences is constitutive.},

Learning plays a crucial role in predator avoidance [1], [2] and [3], but little is known about how the type of experience with predators molds future prey behavior. Specifically, is predator-avoidance learning and memory retention disrupted by cryptic coloration of predators, such as crab spiders [4] and [5]? How does experience with different predators affect foraging decisions? We evaluated these questions by exposing foraging bumblebees to controlled predation risk from predators (robotic crab spiders) that were either cryptic or highly contrasting, as assessed by a quantitative model of bee color perception [6]. Our results from 3D tracking software reveal a speed-accuracy tradeoff [7]: Bees slow their inspection flights after learning that there is a risk from cryptic spiders. The adjustment of inspection effort results in accurate predator detection, leveling out predation risk at the expense of foraging time. Overnight-retention tests reveal no decline in performance, but bees that had experienced cryptic predators are more prone to "false alarms" (rejection of foraging opportunities on safe flowers) than those that had experienced conspicuous predators. Therefore, bees in the cryptic-spider treatment made a functional decision to trade off reduced foraging efficiency via increased inspection times and false-alarm rates against higher potential fitness loss from being injured or eaten.},

We report the results of a meta-analysis of 346 pairwise comparisons of forest insect fitness on novel and ancient host tree species from 31 publications.

Overall, fitness was significantly lower on novel host species than on ancient hosts. However, in some cases, fitness increased on novel hosts, mainly in polyphagous insects or when close relatives of ancient host trees were colonized.

	abstract = {Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km2 to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models ({SDMs}) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Goal, Scope and Background. The degree to which dose responses of model organisms (lab rodents) can adequately predict dose
responses of free-ranging wild mammals or amphibians is unknown, and the relative sensitivity of such species to body loading
of a toxicant such as glyphosate is seldom reported. For relative effects of dosage, we compare sensitivity of nine wild vertebrate
species to effects of high doses of glyphosate in Swiss-Webster laboratory mice both by gavage and by intraperitoneal injection.
We also evaluate sublethal effects of herbicide exposure on behavior and reproductive success of one mammal and one amphibian
species  


Methods  Comparisons of acute toxicity of glyphosate were made with intraperitoneal dosings of technical glyphosate isopropylamine
salt to nine species of terrestrial vertebrates (five amphibians, four mammals) and compared with responses in Swiss-Webster
laboratory mice. Animals collected from sites that had no recent herbicide application were allowed 7–14 days to equilibrate
in captivity before treatment.



Results  Median lethal dose ranged from 800 to 1,340 mg kg-1 in mammals, and 1,170 to {\textgreater}2,000 mg kg−1 in amphibians, with Oregon vole being the most sensitive. White lab mice were in the middle of the mammalian range. Tailed
frog, at {\textgreater}2,000 mg kg−1 was the least sensitive. Calibration of {IP} sensitivity to oral administration by gavage indicated that roughly four times
as much glyphosate must be administered to obtain a comparable estimate of lethality. Administration by gavage in highly concentrated
solutions tended to cause physical injury, hence may prove less useful as a relative indicator of toxicity. When sublethal
dosages were given to roughskin newts or chipmunks, mobility and use of cover appeared largely unaffected.



Discussion  Direct toxic effects of spraying glyphosate under normal forest management seem unlikely for the nine species examined. Nor
could we detect significant indirect effects of exposure on behavior and use of cover features in two species. There may be
effects on other aspects of the field biology of these animals, such as reproductive rates, which we did not investigate.
Recent field data indicate that changes in habitat quality following herbicide application can result in high reproductive
activity in species associated with the grasses and forbs that proliferate following field applications.



Conclusions  When compared to field data on body burdens of wild mammals exposed after aerial application of glyphosate at maximum rates
in forests, there seems to be a large margin of safety between dosages encountered and those causing either death or limitation
of movement, foraging or shelter.



Recommendations and Perspectives  Margins of safety for small mammals and amphibians appear to be large under any probable exposure scenarios, however our results
indicate high variability in responses among species. Uncertainty introduced into field studies from unknown sources of mortality
(e.g, likely predation) must be considered when interpreting our results.},

	abstract = {Covariance between preference and performance was quantified for Papilio glaucus strains derived from a locally monophagous Florida population and a locally polyphagous Ohio population. I used two-choice assays to assess relative host preferences of mothers for plant species that represent reciprocal normal and novel hosts for each population (i.e., Liriodendron tulipifera and Magnolia virginiana) and a split-brood design to quantify relative performance of their progeny on each host. Covariance between preference and proxies of performance was detected independently within each population, which is a level of genetic structure at which such covariance has rarely been documented. These results support the hypothesis that preference-performance covariance can exist in populations that have no obvious internal host-associated structure. In the Ohio strain, all proxies of performance (larval duration, pupal mass, relative growth rate, and survival) were significantly correlated with relative preference for the normal host, L. tulipifera. In the Florida strain, however, only pupal mass was correlated with maternal preference, and this correlation was not in the direction expected. Progeny that attained the heaviest mass were derived from mothers that preferred L. tulipifera, the locally rare host. The nature of the preference-performance links was not in the manner predicted by conventional optimal oviposition theory, whereby host-associated tradeoffs have been considered an implicit element. Relative performance was congruent across hosts, regardless of whether mothers preferred L. tulipifera, M. virginiana, or neither host. After considering possible genetic and nongenetic explanations that could account for preference-performance covariance in P. glaucus, I conclude that this covariance has a genetic basis. Likely, multiple genetic control mechanisms (e.g., pleiotropy and co-adaptation) integrate at the level of different trait combinations and/or a particular trait combination to generate observed patterns.},

Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with {LAPACK}, or one its high-performance drop-in replacements, such as {MKL} from Intel or {ACML} from {AMD}. A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through C++ template meta-programming. Performance comparisons suggest that the library is considerably faster than Matlab and Octave, as well as previous C++ libraries such as {IT}++ and Newmat.},

	abstract = {Aim Spatial autocorrelation ({SAC}) in data, i.e. the higher similarity of closer samples, is a common phenomenon in ecology. {SAC} is starting to be considered in the analysis of species distribution data, and over the last 10 years several studies have incorporated {SAC} into statistical models (here termed ‘spatial models’). Here, I address the question of whether incorporating {SAC} affects estimates of model coefficients and inference from statistical models.Methods I review ecological studies that compare spatial and non-spatial models.Results In all cases coefficient estimates for environmental correlates of species distributions were affected by {SAC}, leading to a mis-estimation of on average c. 25\%. Model fit was also improved by incorporating {SAC}.Main conclusions These biased estimates and incorrect model specifications have implications for predicting species occurrences under changing environmental conditions. Spatial models are therefore required to estimate correctly the effects of environmental drivers on species present distributions, for a statistically unbiased identification of the drivers of distribution, and hence for more accurate forecasts of future distributions.},

The proliferation of methods and uncertainty regarding their effectiveness can be daunting to researchers, resource managers and conservation planners alike. Franklin summarizes the methods used in species distribution modeling (also called niche modeling) and presents a framework for spatial prediction of species distributions based on the attributes (space, time, scale) of the data and questions being asked. The framework links theoretical ecological models of species distributions to spatial data on species and environment, and statistical models used for spatial prediction.

	issn = {00335770},
	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2827868},
	abstract = {Since the survival and well-being of humankind is so inextricably bound to our domestic animals and plants, it is important that we understand the domestication process and its biological consequences. The objective of this review is to discuss available information on the biological basis of animal domestication, with particular emphasis on behavior. Domestication concerns adaptation, which is usually to a captive environment and which is achieved by some combination of genetic changes occurring over generations, as well as by environmentally induced changes in development that recur during each generation. Genetic changes will occur in population of organisms undergoing domestication as a result of both chance and of any shift in selection pressures accompanying the transition from nature to captivity. In addition to changes in gene frequencies, adaptation to the captive environment may be facilitated by certain recurring environmental events or management practices that influence the development of specific biological traits. It is difficult to generalize about the effects of domestication on either genetic or phenotypic variability because of different selection pressures on different traits and species. However, it is apparent that, with respect to animal behavior, domestication has influenced the quantitative rather than qualitative nature of the response. The postulated loss of certain behavior patterns under domestication can usually be explained by a heightening of response thresholds above normal levels of stimulation. Conversely, lowered thresholds of response often can be accounted for by constant exposure to certains forms of stimulation. Certain behaviors may have been altered because of man's role as a buffer between the animal and its environment. One of the more important behavioral changes accompanying the domestication process is a reduction in responsiveness to changes in the animal's environment. Food provisioning and man's control over the breeding process have reduced competition for important resources, and thus have permitted selection for the retention of juvenile characteristics (neotony). Feralization is the domestication process in reverse. The capacity of domestic animals to survive in nature may depend on the extent to which the gene pool of the population has been altered during the domestication process. "Natural" gene pools should be protected when breeding wild animals in captivity for the purpose of reestablishing free-living natural populations.},

But modelling spatial relationships, especially in large point data sets, presents major computational challenges. We use a novel Bayesian hierarchical statistical approach, ‘spatial predictive process’ modelling, to predict the distribution of a major invasive plant species, Celastrus orbiculatus, in the northeastern {USA}. The model runs orders of magnitude faster than traditional geostatistical models on a large data set of c. 4000 points, and performs better than generalized linear models, generalized additive models and geographically weighted regression in cross-validation. We also use this approach to model simultaneously the distributions of a set of four major invasive species in a spatially explicit multivariate model. This multispecies analysis demonstrates that some pairs of species exhibit negative residual spatial covariation, suggesting potential competitive interaction or divergent responses to unmeasured factors.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and {GARP} and {BIOCLIM}, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species’ distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species’ occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species’ distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

The first approach (macroecological modelling, {MEM}) focuses directly on realized properties of species assemblages, whereas the second approach (stacked species distribution modelling, S-{SDM}) starts with constituent species to approximate the properties of assemblages. Here, we propose to unify the two approaches in a single ‘spatially explicit species assemblage modelling’ ({SESAM}) framework. This framework uses relevant designations of initial species source pools for modelling, macroecological variables, and ecological assembly rules to constrain predictions of the richness and composition of species assemblages obtained by stacking predictions of individual species distributions. We believe that such a framework could prove useful in many theoretical and applied disciplines of ecology and evolution, both for improving our basic understanding of species assembly across spatio-temporal scales and for anticipating expected consequences of local, regional or global environmental changes. In this paper, we propose such a framework and call for further developments and testing across a broad range of community types in a variety of environments.},

Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. {MRT} can be used to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions.

	abstract = {Signals of species interactions can be inferred from survey data by asking if some species occur more or less often together than what would be expected by random, or more generally, if any structural aspect of the community deviates from that expected from a set of independent species. However, a positive (or negative) association between two species does not necessarily signify a direct or indirect interaction, as it can result simply from the species having similar (or dissimilar) habitat requirements. We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over- or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements. We use our results to derive hypotheses on species interactions that can be tested in future experimental work.},

Single-species and three-species assemblages were exposed to single commercial mushrooms on wet pine shavings in 200 ml culture bottles. A predacious rove beetle (Ontholestes cingulatus) was present in half of the three-species replicates. The stocked adult flies and beetles were removed after 4 days, and the number, biomass and mean mass of emerging progeny was recorded. 3. For all three species the abundance and biomass of the progeny emerging in the 'no predator' communities' was significantly less than for the progeny emerging in single-species replicates, suggesting an interspecific competitive effect. D.tripunctata was the competitive dominant; it emerged in abundance from all seven three-species 'no predator' communities while D.putrida and D.falleni were often excluded. 4. The decrease in production was attributed to strong interspecific competition among larva and not interference among ovipositing adults. 5. Predation on ovipositing adults significantly reduced the number and biomass of D.tripunctata progeny emerging, and indirectly facilitated the number and biomass of emerging D.falleni and D.putrida.Predation on adults reduced larval recruitment, relaxed larval competition, and released the inferior competitors.},

When a controlled reinforce-ratio procedure was used, relative stimulus frequency was constant at .5, and relative reinforcer frequency for correct detections was held constant at three different values for each of five luminance differences. When an uncontrolled reinforcer-ratio procedure (the typical detection paradigm) was used, relative reinforcer frequency for correct detections was allowed to covary with changes in relative stimulus frequency for each of five luminance differences. Two measures of bias, response bias (Davison \& Tustin, 1978) and the detection-theory likelihood-ratio measure (beta obt), were compared. The controlled reinforcer-ratio procedure generated equal- or iso-response-bias functions, and the uncontrolled reinforcer-ratio procedure gave changing or alloio-response-bias functions. The Davison-Tustin model accounted for 88\% and 93\% of the data variance in the controlled and uncontrolled reinforcer-ratio procedures, respectively. The best-fitting equal-beta functions accounted for an average of 53\% and 69\%, respectively, in the two procedures. In addition, neither procedure gave constant measures of beta obt for constant bias manipulations across different discriminability measures.},

These networks have previously been seen primarily as a means of representing knowledge derived from experts. Here it is shown that the “Gibbs sampling” simulation procedure for such networks can support maximum-likelihood learning from empirical data through local gradient ascent. This learning procedure resembles that used for “Boltzmann machines”, and like it, allows the use of “hidden” variables to model correlations between visible variables. Due to the directed nature of the connections in a belief network, however, the “negative phase” of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. Experimental results show that, as a result, learning in a sigmoid belief network can be faster than in a Boltzmann machine. These networks have other advantages over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications, are naturally applicable to unsupervised learning problems, and provide a link between work on connectionist learning and work on the representation of expert knowledge.},

We examine experimentally whether misidentification of prey items or sampling of presentation schedules alone can account for this result. They cannot, and we therefore conclude that a factor other than energetic efficiency is influencing the foraging behaviour. This idea is supported by the finding that hungry great tits follow the predictions of energetic efficiency more closely than partially satiated ones. We suggest that the partial preferences shown in this specific experiment are due to the combined action of satiation and prey misidentification: as the birds satiate they appear to aim less and less at a maximal energy intake rate; they apply an increasingly stringent criterion which leads to a shift of diet.},

The animals initiated tone presentations by breaking a light beam at the rear of the chamber. Correct choices produced brain-stimulation reinforcement, and errors produced a timeout. A procedure designed by Jenkins was used to partial out choice data under potential control of sequential cues in the stimulus series. When the standard-comparison intensity difference was varied, the rats showed similar psychometric functions despite wide differences in response bias (relative position preference). A signal detection analysis showed that response biases for individual animals remained fairly consistent during psychophysical testing. The trend of decreasing choice accuracy at small intensity differences was described by the cumulative normal probability function. The similarity of psychometric functions obtained with 70- and 100-db standards supported Weber's law. There was some evidence that response latencies were controlled by intensity differences even when choice behavior was undifferentiated.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the {ANUSPLIN} package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

This research comprises 146 samples from 65 studies of 42 species of four major taxa. We present the results of a meta-analysis of these studies, which demonstrates that there is indeed an overall significant, moderate negative relationship: for studies, the overall mean Pearson's r or effect size = -.42, P {\textless} .0005; for species, the overall mean r = -.34, .01 {\textless} P {\textless} .025 Based on calculated fail-safe numbers, the effect-size estimates are highly robust against any publication or reporting bias that may exist. There is considerable evidence that the magnitude of the negative correlation between fluctuating asymmetry and success related to sexual selection is greater for males than for females, when a secondary sexual trait rather than an ordinary trait is studied, with experimentation compared with observation, and for traits not involved with mobility compared with traits affecting mobility. There is also limited evidence that higher taxa may differ in effect size and that intensity of sexual selection negatively correlates with effect size.},

	abstract = {* 1Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. * 2This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees ({BRT}), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final {BRT} model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. * 3Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in {BRT} overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although {BRT} models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. * 4The unique features of {BRT} raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using {BRT} through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of {BRT} by ecologists.},

Three sites 2013 two above a stream junction ('upper' reach and 'pond') and one below ('lower' reach) 2013 allowed us to compare the behavior of salmon in the presence and absence of olfactory cues and habitat similarity. Most controls of both sexes (90\%) remained in the immediate vicinity of the tagging and release site. When displaced downstream, where the odors of both the upper reach and the pond were detectable, most salmon returned to their former site (65\%). Displaced sockeye were more likely to return to the pond from the lower reach than from the upper one (P = 0.05), consistent with olfactory orientation and the hypothesis that salmon prefer certain habitats. Salmon displaced from the upper to the lower reach were much more likely to return than those displaced to the pond (P \&lt; 0.01), consistent with the role of odors in orientation and inconsistent with the habitat choice hypothesis.},

	abstract = {We integrated genetics and demography into population modeling in the context of species restorations, in which both the origin of released individuals and the management strategy may influence the success of introduction. Through an explicit individual-based simulation approach, we investigated the effects of the age of released individuals by exploring the relative merits of releasing juveniles or adults to establish populations. We included the effect of genetic variability responsible for inbreeding depression and mutational meltdown. Our general analysis uncovered an interaction between the age of founders and the extent of intrapopulation fitness variability, which substantially influenced the efficiency of selection in populations founded by juveniles and had subsequent positive consequences for long-term persistence compared with the case in which adults were released. We then applied the model to the case of the reintroduction of the Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus fulvus) to southern France, for which post-release data were available. The demographic aspects of this reintroduction were already analyzed and published, suggesting that it is more efficient to release adults than juveniles, despite an observed reduction of demographic parameters following the release of adults. In that context, the inclusion of genetic considerations qualitatively changes the conclusion, predicting reduced long-term extinction risk if juveniles rather than adults are released. Integramos genética y demografía a un modelo poblacional en el contexto de restauración de especies, donde, tanto el origen de los individuos liberados y la estrategia de gestión pueden influir en el éxito de la reintroducción. Investigamos los efectos de la edad de los individuos liberados mediante la exploración de los méritos relativos de la liberación de juveniles o adultos para establecer poblaciones, por medio de un método de simulación basada en un individuo explícito. Incluimos el efecto de la variabilidad genética responsable de la depresión por endogamia y catástrofe mutacional. Nuestro análisis general descubrió una interacción entre la edad de fundadores y el grado de variabilidad de adaptabilidad intrapoblacional, que influyó sustancialmente en la eficiencia de la selección en poblaciones fundadas por juveniles y tuvo consecuencias positivas subsecuentes sobre la persistencia a largo plazo en comparación con el caso de la liberación de adultos. Posteriormente aplicamos el modelo a la reintroducción del buitre griffon (Gyps fulvus fulvus) en el sur de Francia, de la que había datos post-liberación disponibles. Los aspectos demográficos de esta reintroducción ya habían sido analizados y publicados, sugiriendo que es más eficiente liberar adultos que juveniles, a pesar de una reducción de parámetros demográficos observada después de la liberación de adultos. En ese contexto, la inclusión de consideraciones genéticas cambia la conclusión cualitativamente, prediciendo la reducción en el riesgo de extinción a largo plazo si se liberan juveniles en lugar de adultos.},

During that brief period Price made three lasting contributions to evolutionary theory; these were: (i) the Price Equation, a profound insight into the nature of selection and the basis for the modern theories of kin and group selection; (ii) the theory of games and animal behavior, based on the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy; and (iii) the modern interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, Fisher's theorem being perhaps the most cited and least understood idea in the history of evolutionary genetics. This paper summarizes Price's contributions and briefly outlines why, toward the end of his painful intellectual journey, he chose to focus his deep humanistic feelings and sharp, analytical mind on abstract problems in evolutionary theory.},

Here, we use these disjunctions as the basis for a natural removal experiment to investigate competitive interactions between Nothofagus and a range of other widespread conifer and broad-leaved tree species. We first model the abundance of non-Nothofagus species as a function of environment, using Generalized Additive Models ({GAMs}) and an extensive data set sampling much of New Zealand's remaining old-growth forests. We then assess the effects of competitive interaction with Nothofagus by adding statistical terms describing (1) Nothofagus abundance, and (2) interactions between Nothofagus abundance and annual temperature, the dominant environmental gradient. Results indicate substantial reductions in the abundance of many species as Nothofagus abundance increases. The magnitude of this reduction varies with position along the dominant environmental gradient; species overlapping most strongly with Nothofagus are generally most sensitive to increases in Nothofagus abundance. In addition, both the shapes of species responses to mean annual temperature and the positions of their optima change as Nothofagus abundance increases. This demonstration of competition using community compositional data has implications both for vegetation theory and for prediction of the likely impacts of global warming on New Zealand's forest pattern.},
